Date: 25 February 2026

<i> The Independent </i>

In a recent speech at the House of Commons, MP Lee Anderson (Reform UK) talked about how there's a need to have an immigration policy that aligns with the economic needs of the nation. Such a statement has been called out by supports of Reform UK who have adopted a hardline stance towards immigration. Spokesperson of Reform UK, Zia Yusuf, has released a statement that Reform UK retains it's policy of anti-immigration, but has pointed out that immigration remains key to the British Economy. Is Reform UK shifting to the left, abandoning it's voters?
